# ðŸ“ŠCredit Card Transaction & Customer Report â€“ Power BI Dashboard

ðŸ”¹ Project Objective
	- The objective of this project is to analyze credit card transactions and customer behavior to generate actionable business insights. The dashboard helps financial institutions and stakeholders:
	- Track revenue, transactions, and interest earned.
	- Understand customer demographics (age, gender, education, job, income groups).
	- Identify credit card usage patterns by category, expenditure type, and customer satisfaction.
	- Monitor weekly and quarterly revenue trends for performance tracking.

ðŸ”¹ Steps Followed
	- Data Preparation :
		- Gathered data from Credit Card Transactions and Customer Details tables.
		- Cleaned and transformed raw data using Power Query in Power BI.
		- Ensured relationships between Client Number (common key).
	- Data Modeling & Calculations:
		- Created new calculated columns and measures using DAX:
		- Categorized Age Groups and Income Groups using SWITCH function.
		- Created a new column Revenue = Total Transaction Amount + Interest + Annual Fee.
		- Created Week Number 2 column for proper chronological tracking.
		- Built measures for Current Week Revenue and Previous Week Revenue to calculate growth.
	- Dashboard Design:
		- Designed two dashboards:
			- Credit Card Transaction Report â€“ Focused on transaction performance.
			- Credit Card Customer Report â€“ Focused on customer demographics and segmentation.
		- Used a mix of charts (bar, line, donut, cards, slicers) for better visualization.

ðŸ”¹ DAX Formulas Used

	Age Group Categorization :

		AgeGroup = SWITCH(
		    TRUE(),
		    'cust_detail'[Customer_Age]<30,"20-30",
		    'cust_detail'[Customer_Age]>=30 && cust_detail[Customer_Age]<40, "30-40",
		    'cust_detail'[Customer_Age]>=40 && cust_detail[Customer_Age]<50, "40-50",
		    'cust_detail'[Customer_Age]>=50 && cust_detail[Customer_Age]<60, "50-60",
		    'cust_detail'[Customer_Age]>=60 ,"60+",
		    "Unknown")


	Income Group Categorization :

		 IncomeGroup = switch(
		    TRUE(),
		    'cust_detail'[Income]<35000,"Low-Income",
		    'cust_detail'[Income]>=35000 && 'cust_detail'[Income]<70000,"Middle-Income",
		    'cust_detail'[Income]>=70000, "High_Income",
		    "Unknown")


	Revenue Calculation :

		Revenue = credit_card[Annual_Fees] + credit_card[Total_Trans_Amt] + credit_card[Interest_Earned]


	Week-on-Week Revenue Comparison :

		Current_Week_Revenue = CALCULATE(
		     sum(credit_card[Revenue]),
		     FILTER(
		        ALL(credit_card),
		        credit_card[Week_num2]=MAX(credit_card[Week_num2])))

		Previous_Week_Revenue = CALCULATE(
		     sum(credit_card[Revenue]),
		     FILTER(
		        ALL(credit_card),
		        credit_card[Week_num2]=MAX(credit_card[Week_num2])-1))

ðŸ”¹ Insights Generated
	- From the dashboards, the following key insights were observed:
	- Revenue Performance:
		- Total Revenue generated: 23M.
		- Total Transactions: 19M, with 3.32M interest and 278K transaction count.
	- Customer Segmentation:
		- Majority of revenue is generated from middle-aged groups (30â€“50 yrs).
		- High-income groups and graduates contribute significantly to revenue.
		- Male customers dominate transactions compared to female customers.
	- Credit Card Usage:
		- Gold and Platinum card categories contribute higher revenue.
		- Travel and grocery expenditures are top contributors to spending.
	-Trends:
		- Seasonal spikes in Q2 and Q4 revenues.
		- Week-on-week analysis shows growth opportunities and revenue dips.

ðŸ”¹ Action Items
	- Based on insights, the following actions are recommended:
		- Customer Retention â€“ Focus marketing campaigns on high-value customer groups (30â€“50 yrs, graduates, high-income).
		- Product Strategy â€“ Promote Platinum and Gold cards to maximize revenue.
		- Revenue Growth â€“ Encourage more transactions in low-performing categories (like utilities).
		- Customer Satisfaction â€“ Track satisfaction scores and reduce delinquent accounts to improve loyalty.
		- Seasonal Planning â€“ Leverage Q2 and Q4 peaks with targeted offers and cashback schemes.

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Technologies
	- Power BI â€“ Data cleaning, modeling, DAX measures, and visualization.
	- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) â€“ Custom calculations and measures.
	- SQL â€“ Used for initial data preparation (views & queries).

ðŸ”¹ Final Dashboard Preview
	- Credit Card Transaction Report â€“ Transaction KPIs, revenue by expenditure, card usage, quarterly & weekly analysis.
	- Credit Card Customer Report â€“ Customer demographics, income & education segmentation, satisfaction score analysis.

 âœ¨ This project demonstrates how business intelligence dashboards can convert raw financial data into meaningful insights that support data-driven decision-making.
